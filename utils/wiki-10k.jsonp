His theory was that it is easier to then adjust to a slower curveball. Robinson also noted that \"Sisler showed me how to stop lunging, how to check my swing until the last fraction of a second\". The teaching helped Robinson raise his batting average from .296 in 1948 to .342 in 1949. In addition to his improved batting average, Robinson stole 37 bases that season, was second place in the league for both doubles and triples, and had 124 runs batted in with 122 runs scored. For the performance Robinson earned the Most Valuable Player award for the National League. Baseball fans also voted Robinson as the starting second baseman for the 1949 All-Star Game.

Initially, some people did not feel comfortable giving loans to disadvantaged people instead of donations. Others disagreed with investing the church's money in something believed to be unlikely to work and yield no financial profit. However, many people from churches throughout Europe believed in the idea of Oikocredit and established Oikocredit support groups in the late 1970s. Through these support groups, private individuals, church communities, associations, foundations, and other organizations could invest in Oikocredit, which had previously been reserved for churches.

{"title": "Standard deviation", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard%20deviation", "text": "The answer is the population standard deviation. The formula is only true if the eight numbers we started with are the whole group. If they are only a part of the group picked at random, then we can obtain an unbiased estimate of what the population standard deviation is by dividing by  instead of  in the bottom (denominator) of the formula above. Then the answer is the (bias-corrected) sample standard deviation. This is called the Bessel's Correction. We often use this correction because the sample variance, i.e., the square of the sample standard deviation, is an unbiased estimator of the population variance, in other words, the expected value or long-run average of the sample variance equals the population (true) variance. However, it is not the case that the sample standard deviation is an unbiased estimator of the population standard deviation. Although Bessel's correction is an unbiased estimate of the variance, this estimate does have a higher mean square error than the biased estimate, or in other words, the biased estimate (that is, dividing by n rather than n-1) is on average closer to the true value."}

It became history after the \"sandbar fight\" on the banks of the Mississippi River in September 1827.  This started as a duel but quickly became a fight between the two seconds, Judge Crane and Jim Bowie. Crane pulled out a pistol and shot at Bowie twice. One bullet hit Bowie in the leg the other killed an onlooker. Friends on both sides began shooting and slashing with knives. Bowie was wounded several times but managed to kill one assailant and wound another with what witnesses called a \"big butcher knife\". This made both Bowie, the knife-fighter, and his knife famous. More than a dozen knifemakers of the time claim to have made the first Bowie knife. But no one knows who made the first one or exactly what it looked like."}

This was the heaviest day of the fighting. Both wings of the Confederates attacked while their artillery concentrated on the Union line at Hazel Grove. The larger Union army held nearly all of the most strategic spots on the battlefield. Of these the key to the battle was Hazel Grove, a high open plateau that overlooked all the Union positions. Stuart realized this and early in the morning Confederates attacked up the slopes of Hazel Grove and captured about 100 men and four artillery pieces. For unknown reasons Hooker had ordered the artillery back from Hazel Grove. At the time of the attack, most of the artillery had already been removed. This was a costly mistake since the Confederate artillery could now fire down on the union positions with great ease. This finally forced the Union line back to a defensive position with his back to the river. Meanwhile, the other Union forces were advancing on Lee from the east. Lee split his army again and met and defeated the Federals near Salem Church (Fredericksburg). This was by far the bloodiest day of fighting. The fighting at Salem Church resulted in more casualties than the entire First Battle of Bull Run."}

J\u00fcrgen Trittin, the Minister of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, reached an agreement with energy companies on the gradual shut down of the country's nineteen nuclear power plants and a cessation of civil usage of nuclear power by 2020. Legislation was enacted in the Nuclear Exit Law. The power plants in Stade and Obrigheim were turned off on November 14, 2003, and May 11, 2005, respectively. Dismantling of the plants is scheduled to begin in 2007. But the Nuclear Exit Law did not ban enrichment stations - one in Gronau has received permission to extend operations. There have been concerns over the safety of the phase-out, particularly in terms of the transport of nuclear waste. In 2005 Angela Merkel won the German federal election in 2005 with the CDU party. She has subsequently announced to re-negotiate with energy companies the time limit for a shut down of nuclear power stations. But as part of her pact with the SPD, with whom the CDU form a coalition, the phase-out policy has for now been retained."}

Watson was only one psychologist to criticize cognitive psychology. Pierre Marie in 1906 criticized Broca, who was one of the first to create the field of Cognitive Neuropsychology.

Frame dragging states that since spacetime is elastic, it can also give the spin-energy back to the particle. Once the particle has all of  its spin-energy given back to it, it acts most like a wave. At that point, it will once again begin using its energy bunching up spacetime. Once the particle is no longer spinning, it acts most like a particle. Then, spacetime begins giving the particle its energy back, and the cycle continues forever. This is how a particle can actually act like a particle and a wave at nearly the same time. No energy is lost during the cycle due to the conservation of energy."}

If one were to fall into a black hole feet first, the gravity at their feet would be much stronger than at their head, causing the person to be vertically pulled. Along with that, the right side of the body will be pulled to the left, and the left side of the body will be pulled to the right, pushing the sides of the person inward.

The first major biography of Arnold, The Life and Treason of Benedict Arnold, published in 1832 by historian Jared Sparks, was particularly harsh in showing how Arnold's treacherous character was allegedly formed out of childhood experiences. George Canning Hill, who authored a series of moralistic biographies in the mid-19th century, began his 1865 biography of Arnold \"Benedict, the Traitor, was born ...\".  Social historian Brian Carso notes that as the 19th century progressed, the story of Arnold's betrayal took on near-mythic proportions as a part of the national creation story, and was again invoked as sectional conflicts leading up the American Civil War increased. Washington Irving used it as part of an argument against dismemberment of the union in his 1857 Life of George Washington, pointing out that only the unity of New England and the southern states that led to independence was made possible in part by holding West Point. Jefferson Davis and other southern secessionist leaders were unfavorably compared to Arnold, implicitly and explicitly likening the idea of secession to treason. Harper's Weekly published an article in 1861 describing Confederate leaders as \"a few men directing this colossal treason, by whose side Benedict Arnold shines white as a saint.\""}

Certainly, an exhaustive search of all possible combination of keys would take  attempts if each key is n bits long, compared to the  attempts required for a single key. However, Diffie and Hellman, discovered a time-memory tradeoff that could break the scheme in only double the time to break the single-encryption scheme.

Phoenicians then marketed Kashmiri saffron as a dye and a treatment for melancholy. From there, saffron use in foods and dyes spread throughout South Asia. For example, Buddhist monks in India adopted saffron-coloured robes after the Buddha Siddhartha Gautama's death. However, the robes were not dyed with costly saffron but turmeric, a less expensive dye, or jackfruit."}

It is said to have contributed to the fall of the Byzantine Empire, because it killed farmers and caused famine. Also, the empire relied on tax money, and the plague killed many taxpayers.Overall, the Plague of Justinian was a sickness that happened around 1,500 years ago. It started in the city of Constantinople and spread to other parts of the world. Many people got sick and some even died. The disease was caused by bacteria and was spread by fleas on rats. It lasted for several years and caused a lot of damage to the Byzantine Empire by weakening its defenses, harming its economy, and killing large amounts of its population. Even though it was a long time ago, we can still learn from this event and take precautions to prevent the spread of diseases today."}

In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8, and this organization still exists, where some concepts of middle school organization have been adapted to the intermediate grades. As time passed, the junior high school concept increased quickly as new school districts proliferated, or systems modernized buildings and curricula. This expansion continued through the 1960s. Jon Wiles, author of Developing Successful K\u20138 Schools: A Principal's Guide, said that \"[a] major problem\" for the original model was \"the inclusion of the ninth grade\", because of the lack of instructional flexibility, due to the requirement of having to earn high school credits in the ninth grade and that \"the fully adolescent ninth grader in junior high school did not seem to belong with the students experiencing the onset of puberty\"."}

In a twist that would used in later seasons, the first player to lose the individual immunity challenge had to spend the night alone on a separate island. Janu, the one who lost, felt she had freedom when she left, and chose to quit the game at the next tribal council, which saved Stephenie from being voted out for one more round. When Koror was down to six, Tom and Ian worried that they would fall against a possible immunity threat, Gregg, and his close ally Jenn, and started a plan with Caryn and Katie to vote out Gregg when they had the chance. Katie, feeling betrayed by Ian, became even more upset when Ian took Tom with him on a reward instead of her as he had promised. Ian tried to make Katie happy, but she still held bad feelings towards him. The final four: Tom, Ian, Katie, and Jenn, chose to allow the next vote to end in a tie between Jenn and Ian, and Ian won in the fire-making tie-breaker challenge. The last immunity challenge made players stand on buoys for as long as possible; Katie jumped off early, but both Tom and Ian stayed for more than 12 hours. Ian chose to quit the challenge, giving immunity to Tom, after Tom played on his regret for hurting Katie's feelings and breaking his promises to her, and Ian felt that dropping out would make up for the emotional damage he had done. At the last tribal council, Tom voted Ian out of the game. At the last tribal council, Tom's leadership and physical strength against Katie being too dependent on others, led the jury to vote Tom as the Sole Survivor, 6-1."}

In fact, carbon-14 exists in all living things; all plants and animals contain carbon-14.  However, carbon-14 is radioactive. It decays by beta decay to become nitrogen-14. Carbon-14, in the small amounts found about us in nature, is harmless.  In archeology, this kind of carbon is used to determine the age of wood and other formerly living things. The method is called radiocarbon dating."}

Because it is impossible to verify the system completely without a pressurized casing (as described below), it is necessary to remove the piston to inspect it. The cost of removing the piston is such that it makes no economic sense to re-install the old cylinder; therefore it is necessary to replace the cylinder and install a new piston. Another solution to protect against a cylinder blowout is to install a \"life jacket.\" This is a device which, in the event of an excessive downward speed, clamps onto the cylinder and stops the car.

{"title": "Abugida", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abugida", "text": "Some abugidas allow for consonant strings to be written down in a single consonant space. For example, in Khmer script, unlike in Thai script, consonants can be written on top of each other, with most consonants having normal and subscript forms. For example, the Khmer word phnom \u1797\u17d2\u1793\u17c6 as in Phnom Penh is written in one consonant space with three consonants, with \u1797 being ph, \u17d2\u1793 being the subscript form of \u1793 n, and \u17c6being the final -m to be pronounced after the vowel. Even though the word is written as phnm, the vowel o is the inherent vowel, thus it should be pronounced phnom. An example of a word with stacked consonants and a vowel is sri \u179f\u17d2\u179a\u17b8, in which \u179f is s, \u17d2\u179a is the subscript form of \u179a r, and \u17b8 being the vowel i."}

He managed to composed Don Pasquale which is one of the best comic operas every written, but it does have a lot of music that he had written earlier.

In 1847 some friends arranged for him to stay with them, but he was very ill by then. He was paralysed and almost unable to speak. His friends looked after him until he died."}

Many estates were blessed with picturesque ruins of monastic houses and (in Italy) Roman villas; others, lacking such buildings, constructed their own sham versions of these romantic structures. Such structures were often dubbed \"[name of architect or builder]'s Folly\", after the single individual who commissioned or designed the project. However, very few follies are completely without a practical purpose. Apart from their decorative aspect, many originally had a use which was lost later, such as hunting towers. Follies are misunderstood structures, according to The Folly Fellowship, a charity that exists to celebrate the history and splendour of these often neglected buildings."}

The third caliph Uthman ibn Affan had been murdered by rebel Muslim groups who had political motives. After Ali took over, the most important problem he faced was that of punishing those responsible for murder. However many people felt that before accepting the position of the caliph, Ali should have focused his attention on finding and punishing the murderers. A group of people led by Muhammad's wife Aisha, her brothers in law Talhah and Zubair ibn al-Awam refused to recognize Ali's caliphate. They instead raised an army which met Ali's army at Basra in Iraq, originally for the purposes of negotiations. In the night, some fighting broke out, probably out of confusion or due to rebel groups who were involved in the infamous murder. This led to the Battle of Bassorah (also known as Battle of the Camel) in which Ali's party emerged victorious. Aisha was escorted back to Medina honorably after the battle by Ali."}

As a friend of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Livingstone was appointed personally by him to advise officials and mayoral candidates in Caracas, in order to help transform the city, which journalist Rory Carroll described as suffering from, \"Gridlocked traffic, a crumbling centre, hillside slums, horrific murder rates, corrupt police and inept local government\". Livingstone reckoned that in twenty years a \"first-world city\" can be made out of Caracas, stating, \"I have a very extensive network of contacts both domestically and internationally which I will be calling on to assist in this.\" No decision on a salary for the ex-mayor has been made, although he mentioned that, \"The whole cost of this trip has been paid for by the government of Venezuela and as an unemployed citizen I would not be able to pay for my own fare otherwise.\" The appointment follows on from the controversy surrounding the deal brokered by Livingstone in February 2007 for the Greater London Authority and Transport for London to provide advice to Venezuela in exchange for cheap fuel to help with bus subsidies. The deal was later overturned by new mayor Boris Johnson, and Livingstone offered his services to Ch\u00e1vez so that Venezuela gets the \"advice that we promised\". Livingstone played down any accusations that his close relationship with the Venezuelan President was controversial, \"unless you believe American propaganda\", while a spokesperson for Johnson said, \"Ken Livingstone is free, as a private individual, to offer his advice and services to whomever he wants.\" Livingstone is now being touted as a key asset for Ch\u00e1vez in the upcoming November elections in the country."}

The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. A new feature called \"Dynamic Comebacks\" gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New \"wake up taunts\" bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as Randy Orton pounding on the ground before his RKO finishing maneuver).

The first musket made in the united States was the Springfield Model 1795 Musket. In the 1800's, better ammunition and ways of firing the gun, meant that rifling was practical for military use, and the rifled musket became common. A few years later, the use of cartridges, breechloading, and multiple rounds of ammunition meant the \"rifled musket\" gave way to the rifle, and \"muskets\" were no longer used."}

Minella deployed the team following the 2-3-5, the so-called \"WM\", module particularly popular in South America in those years. The 1946 season saw River hit third place, five points behind the winner, San Lorenzo de Almagro. In 1947 the team led by Minella was still champion, again one day from the end of the championship, defeating Rosario Central. In the 1950s the coach made an important contribution to the club's victories, which followed one another shortly after between 1952 and 1957. Key elements of that team were \u00c1ngel Labruna, N\u00e9stor Rossi and Amadeo Carrizo. The first trophy was obtained not without difficulty, while in 1953 the River got the better of Racing from Avellaneda; in 1955 the title also came thanks to a positive streak of 16 matches. In 1956 and 1957 the championships were dominated by River, but following the transfer of Omar S\u00edvori to Juventus , the period of success came to an end, and Minella left the bench. In 1964 the coach was called by the Argentine Football Federation to hold the position of coach of the Albiceleste national team ; he made his debut on May 31 in Rio de Janeiro against Portugal. Minella was called up to direct the selection during the Ta\u00e7a das Na\u00e7\u00f5es, a tournament that included four national teams. In this event the Argentines obtained the victory, thanks to the three successes with Portugal, Brazil and England, all arrived without conceding goals. The CT made some particular choices, placing lesser known elements at the international level alongside already established players. After this title, he was confirmed on the bench, and took part in various tournaments, mainly of a friendly nature, including the Dittborn Cup and the Chevallier Boutell Cup. He was also the coach who led the national team to qualify for England 1966; however, he was replaced by Osvaldo Zubeld\u00eda first and then Juan Carlos Lorenzo, with the latter sitting on the Argentine bench during the Rimet Cup.

She and George then go to the docks to tell Ray, but he refuses to believe them. Julie and George notice Ray's boat is called Billy Blue and run away. Ben appears, knocking Ray unconscious, and invites both Julie and George to hide on his boat. On the boat, they find photos and articles about their friends and them, and pictures of Susie. Ben's boat leaves the docks, and he begins tormenting Julie and George, chasing them below deck; there, they uncover the bodies of Helen, Charlotte and Barry in the boat's ice box. Ray regains consciousness and steals a motorboat to rescue Julie and George. He ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben's hand and send him overboard. When the police question them, they deny knowing why Ben attempted to kill them, but they are relieved not to have actually killed anybody the previous summer, and reconcile."}

Everyone can see that the sun, moon and stars appear to move across the sky. Early civilisations thought this meant they revolved around the Earth, because that is what they always seem to do. We now know this is quite wrong, but discovering the real explanation was the start of modern science (see Copernicus, Galileo and heliocentrism). What they did was to work out an alternative theory or hypothesis, which eventually was shown to be a much better explanation of all the observations. That is real science, but the observations of the heavens, which started with the Babylonians, showed the regularity which needed to be explained. What science did was to prove the obvious explanation was not the right one."}

By August 17, the winds decreased to 20\u00a0mph (30\u00a0km/h), with higher gusts. The system turned to the north-northeast on August 18, while heavy bands of thunderstorms continued to spin around the center of Erin.  Early on August 19 after entering Oklahoma, Erin suddenly re-intensified to maximum sustained winds of 50\u00a0mph (80\u00a0km/h) a short distance west of Oklahoma City.  The Norman, Oklahoma National Weather Service remarked the intensification \"[resulted] in what amounts to an inland tropical storm;\" at 0930\u00a0UTC the system showed an eye-like feature and a spiral rainband, and produced wind gusts of over 80\u00a0mph (130\u00a0km/h).  However, a few hours later, the system began weakening again, and late on August 19 Erin degenerated into a remnant low pressure area as the circulation dissipated over northeastern Oklahoma. The low continued into southeastern Kansas before dissipating, feeding moisture northward toward a frontal system extending from the Midwestern United States through the Mid-Atlantic States.  Its remnant mid-level circulation then moved eastward across Missouri, Kentucky, and Virginia before losing identity as it moved out into the Atlantic Ocean."}

Snipers often paint their faces green or black to make them shine less, and blend in with the surroundings. Sometimes snipers wear special camouflage suits, called ghillie suits. Ghillie suits are made of shredded burlap or yute and often have plants attached to them. Snipers will often make several different ghillie suits to help them hide in different kinds of terrain.

{"title": "Rings of Rhea", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rings%20of%20Rhea", "text": "On November 26, 2005, Cassini made the one targeted Rhea flyby of its primary mission. It passed within 500\u00a0km of Rhea's surface, downstream of Saturn's magnetic field, and saw the resulting plasma wake as it had with other moons, such as Dione and Tethys. In those cases, there was a cutoff of energetic electrons as Cassini crossed into the moons' plasma shadows (the regions where the moons themselves blocked the magnetospheric plasma from reaching Cassini). However, in the case of Rhea, the electron plasma started to drop off at eight times that distance, and decreased gradually until the expected sharp drop off as Cassini entered Rhea's plasma shadow. The extended distance corresponds to Rhea's Hill sphere, the distance of 7.7 times Rhea's radius inside of which orbits are dominated by Rhea's rather than Saturn's gravity. When Cassini emerged from Rhea's plasma shadow, the reverse pattern occurred: A sharp surge in energetic electrons, then a gradual increase out to Rhea's Hill-sphere radius."}

This was Lee's plan to split up his army. McClellan learned Lee had sent General Stonewall Jackson to attack and hold the Harpers Ferry Armory. The information gave McClellan the chance to destroy Lee's army while it was still weakened by Jackson's attack on Harpers Ferry. McClellan learned of Lee's plan on September 13. He boasted \"Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home.\" He also sent a telegram to President Lincoln where he wrote, \"I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency.\" But McClellan waited another 18 hours before acting. This delay allowed Lee more time to collect all the elements of his army. As Lee had moved into Maryland, he left detachments to guard two of the passes through South Mountain, Crampton's Gap and Turner's Gap. These were the two most important routes through the 50-mile long South Mountain. Had McClellan moved a little faster, he would have caught Lee's army scattered on the other side of the mountain."}

While doing psychoanalysis, Beck noticed that his depressed patients had a lot of negative thoughts about themselves, he world, and the future.  They seemed like they were \u2018talking\u2019 to themselves in their thoughts.  However, they only shared some of these thoughts with Beck.

He was the first person to conduct Liszt\u2019s symphonic poems in France. He himself wrote symphonic poems such as Le Rouet d\u2019Omphale (1871) and Danse Macabre (1874).

This was a time of great changes in musical style, from the baroque work of his father, to the classical works of Mozart and Haydn. His music has elements of both, and does not easily fit into the categories that have been created since. Because of this, his music is not played as much in modern times. His father's music has become much more famous, but C. P. E. Bach's music had a greater influence on the composers that came after him."}

Locals witnesses the fresh waterspring in the settlement. The existence of the stream was the reason for the naming of the nearby rue de la source. At the time the spring was used for drinking water. Over time the area around the steam was converted into farmland creating fields like the Klappwissen and the Sauerfeld. It is possible that the Trudlerbaach once flowed from the Pettengerbesch as other streams are sources there. However the development of land and construction of new roads prevented all the groundwater from converging into one stream. The resulted in the tributaries from the Roulend and northern Sh\u00e4ltgen. Water then collected directly underneath one trail which created Lac Beriton. 1996 Faerscthaff was constructed on the banks of the stream, and then expanded in 2001.

No major developments have been constructed on the banks of the river and development in Contern could fill in Lac Beriton and cut the river back to Op der Syrener Head and make the inflows from the source to be exclusively storm drains."}

{"title": "Linear Tape-Open", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear%20Tape-Open", "text": "LTO tapes are read and written to with a tape drive. This is typically connected to a computer using serial attached SCSI, although some tape drives use Fibre Channel. LTO drives are very expensive, but the tapes are much cheaper than an equivalent-sized hard drive or optical disc. Unlike many other tape formats, LTO cartridges contain only a single reel of tape. The other reel is inside the drive. This means that the tape must be rewound before it can be removed from the drive. This makes the cartridge smaller because it does not need to contain an empty reel. It also makes the drives more expensive because they must contain a mechanically complex mechanism to pull the tape out of the cartridge and thread it onto the takeup reel. Unlike most other tape drives, LTO drives do not have a rotating head drum, and do not use helical scan. The head writes tracks in a straight line, like a reel-to-reel audio recorder. This is where the name comes from. The head can, however, move up and down to write multiple tracks to the tape. This is similar to the way an 8 track tape works, although since the head is much smaller, an LTO tape can have hundreds or thousands of tracks (up to 8960 tracks for LTO-9). This allows many terabytes of data (up to 18 TB for LTO-9) to be stored on a single tape."}

He introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. Spearheaded by Ernst Mach and Wilhelm Ostwald, a strong philosophical current that denied the existence of molecules arose towards the end of the 19th century. The molecular existence was considered unproven and the molecular hypothesis unnecessary. At the time Van der Waals's thesis was written (1873), the molecular structure of fluids had not been accepted by most physicists, and liquid and vapor were often considered as chemically distinct. But Van der Waals's work affirmed the reality of molecules and allowed an assessment of their size and attractive strength. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state. By comparing his equation of state with experimental data, Van der Waals was able to obtain estimates for the actual size of molecules and the strength of their mutual attraction."}

Several contemporary prominent Armenians, including Grigor-Derenik Vaspurakan, insisted on Ashot's coronation. Ashot was crowned King of Armenia through the consent of Caliph al-Mu'tamid in 885 to prevent intrusion into Armenian territory by Basil I, a Byzantine emperor of Armenian origin. The establishment of the Bagratuni kingdom later led to the founding of several other Armenian principalities and kingdoms: Taron, Vaspurakan, Kars, Khachen and Syunik. During the reign of Ashot III (952/53\u201377), Ani became the kingdom's capital and grew into a thriving economic and cultural center. The first half of the 11th century saw the decline and eventual collapse of the kingdom. The Byzantine emperor Basil II (r. 976\u20131025) won a string of victories and annexed parts of southwestern Armenia. King Hovhannes-Smbat felt forced to cede his lands and in 1022 promised to \"will\" his kingdom to the Byzantines following his death. However, after Hovhannes-Smbat's death in 1041, his successor, Gagik II, refused to hand over Ani and continued resistance until 1045, when his kingdom, plagued with internal and external threats, was finally taken by Byzantine forces. It can be assumed that Armenia had a population of 5\u20136 million at that time in the (IX-XI centuries)."}

Vasan gave most of the songs on the Hindi soundtrack to Uma Devi, who became famously known as Tun Tun after. She first thought that the songs were too difficult for her, but Rajeswara Rao worked very much with her. \"Sanjh Ki Bela,\" from the Hindi soundtrack, is based on \"Sanjh Ki Bela Panchhi Akela\" from Jwar Bhata (1944). Chandralekha's music helped it become one of the most successful Indian musical movies of the 1940s and gave a lot of ideas to many Tamil cinema music directors who liked Western music."}

Pteranodon, with a wing-span of over 20 feet (7m), and Quetzalcoatlus, with a wingspan of 40 feet (12m) are famous examples. The many dozens of partial skeletons of Pteranodon were found in areas where, in the Cretaceous of North America, there was a gigantic inland sea, the Western Interior Seaway. That makes it more or less certain that Pteranodon was mainly a fish-eating pterosaur. And, other sites in England and Argentina were also, at the time, shallow, warm inland seas.

Fraunhofer never discovered what the black lines were; he suggested they might be boundaries between different colors. Many years later, scientists discovered that these black spectral lines existed because some materials that exist in the sun and in the sky can absorb parts of the light.

It is much less easy to see why a white skin is an advantage in colder climates. Researchers have suggested two reasons, and both probably play a part. The first is that, at a given temperature, a white skin radiates less heat than a black skin. The second is that in weaker sunlight the body tends to produce less vitamin D. There is a hypothesis that the selection for lighter skin is due to the need for higher vitamin D production. The change started as soon as populations moved north out of Africa."}

Formalized under Gregory IX, this Medieval inquisition executed an average of three people per year for heresy at its height. Over time, other inquisitions were launched by the Church or secular rulers. Its main objectives were to prosecute heretics, to respond to the threat of Moorish invasion or for political purposes. The accused were encouraged to renounce their heresy and those who did not could be punished by penance, fines, imprisonment or execution by burning."}

The plane was used by the German Luftwaffe in the World War II. In Germany it was called Zerst\u00f6rer (the destroyer). Early in the war Germany had great success with the plane until they attacked Great Britain. In the Battle of Britain the Bf 110C was no match for Britain's Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters. The planes designed as escorts (to bombers) had to be escorted themselves. They were slow in turns which was a major flaw in the design. The Hurricane's could out-turn them and the Spitfires could out-run them. After very heavy losses they were withdrawn from the battle. The Bf 110s were reassigned to other duties. One role they were well suited for was as night fighters. Major Heinz-Wolfgang Schnaufer, Germany's top night fighter ace, claimed 121 victories flying a Bf 110."}

During the wet season it can rain hard for long periods of time, then not rain at all in the dry season. Savannas that have more rain often have many trees spaced out across their plains. These trees have deep roots or store water, like desert plants do, to live through the long dry seasons without rain. Even drier savannas will have only grass, and that too only in a few clumps. The dry land is very bad for crops, but it is a wonderful place for all kinds of wild animals to gather and range. That is why Kenya has a lot of parks where the animals are kept, and protected from all the hunters. People/tourists come from all over the world to go on photo safaris in Kenya's special wildlife parks.

{"title": "Human", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human", "text": "Human skin colors vary greatly. They can be a very pale pink all the way to dark brown. There is a reason why people in tropical areas have dark skins. The dark pigment (melanin) in the skin protects them against ultraviolet rays in sunlight. The damage caused by UV rays can and does cause skin cancer in some people. Therefore, in more sunny areas, natural selection favors darker skin color. Sun tanning has nothing to do with this issue, because it is just a temporary process which is not inherited. In colder climates the advantage of light-coloured skin is two-fold. It radiates less heat, and it absorbs more sunlight. In weaker sunlight a darker body produces less vitamin D than a lighter body. The selection for lighter skin is driven by these two reasons. Therefore, in less sunny areas, natural selection favours lighter skin colour."}

Freud believes that the superego is what allows the mind to control its impulses that are looked down upon morally.  The superego can be considered to be the conscience of the mind because it has the ability to distinguish between reality as well as what is right or wrong.  Without the superego Freud believes people would act out with aggression and other immoral behaviors because the mind would have no way of understanding the difference between right and wrong.  The superego is considered to be the \u201cconsciousness\u201d of a person\u2019s personality and can override the drives from the id. Freud separates the superego into two separate categories: the ideal self and the conscious.  The conscious contains ideals and morals that exist within society that prevent people from acting out based on their internal desires.  The ideal self contains images of how people ought to behave according to society's ideals."}

A few e-cards came with new copies of the game, while two sets (called \"series\") of cards, were released and sold with the game. By scanning special cards into the e-Reader, players were able to send items, videos, and most importantly, new levels into the game. One important item was the Cape Feather from Super Mario World, which let Mario change into Cape Mario. There were also two Switch cards that the player could turn on (and turn off) the effects of by scanning them; the Orange Switch and the Blue Green Switch. Scanning these switches set off small uses in the game. The e-Reader item is still available in the European form, but has been turned off and cannot be used anymore."}

Hydrogen can form compounds with most elements and is present in water and most organic compounds. It plays a particularly important role in acid-base chemistry, in which many reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. As the only neutral atom for which the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and spectrum of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics."}

He is the inventor of the first grounded lightning rod, which he erected on 15 July 1754 in the garden of his home in P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice u Znojma. It consisted of 400 sharp metal spikes attached at the top of a 42\u00a0m tall supporting pylon. The structure was fastened by three metal chains, conductively attached to the iron grounding cones buried in the packed down soil. He described his 'weather machine' in the treatise 'Descriptio machinae meteorologicae'. The original idea was to continually sap the electricity out of the clouds and so actually prevent the lightning and the storms, only in case this failed, the machine should have also been able to directly attract the lighting and channel it to the ground. He proposed his machine to be used on church towers and ships. He was sending his observations regarding the machine operation to Jan Anton\u00edn Scrinci, the physics professor at the Charles University in Prague, who published them in 'Prager Postzeitungen', 'Br\u00fcnner Intelligenz-Zettel' and in 'Stuttgartisches Journal'. The machine is also mentioned by Leonhard Euler in 'Lettres \u00e0 une Princesse d' Allemagne'. In 1755 Divi\u0161 asked the Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria to let him build more machines on several places for the welfare of the people. The emperor let the mathematicians in Vienna judge the proposal, but they refused it. Abb\u00e9 Marci, court mathematician and Divi\u0161' friend commented: 'Blasphemant, quae ignorant' (condemning what they do not know). In 1756 the machine was damaged by wind and then rebuilt, and then on 10 March 1760, angry villagers of P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice tore down the structure, blaming Divi\u0161 for drought which struck the region that year. Later in the year, after the summer during which the thunderstorms did a lot of damage to the fields and vineyards, the people besought him to rebuild the machine, which he did in the precinct of Loucky monastery, and built another one on the top of the church tower in P\u0159\u00edm\u011btice."}

One of the main parts was sung by Fyodor Stravinsky, who was the father of Igor Stravinsky.  Rimsky-Korsakov had by now become really interested in Russian folktunes and fairy tales.  His next opera was Snow Maiden. Then his friend Mussorgsky died, leaving lots of compositions unfinished.  Rimsky-Korsakov spent a lot of time preparing them for publication.  He made changes to some of Mussorgsky\u2019s harmonies so that it suited his Romantic tastes.  Nowadays many people think that Mussorgsky\u2019s versions are better and that Rimsky-Korsakov had not understood properly what Mussorgsky had been trying to do.  He also completed and orchestrated Borodin\u2019s opera Prince Igor after Borodin died.  He composed two very popular orchestral works: Spanish Capriccio (1887) and Sheherazade (1888).

The Delaware Department of Transportation is responsible for taking care of the numbered roads in Delaware. State routes in Delaware use a highway sign that has the numbers in a white circle on a black square. Delaware's numbering system is like that of the U.S. Highways in that odd numbered highways (1, 3, 5, 7, or 9) travel north-south and even numbered routes (2, 4, 6, 8, or 0) go east-west. The numbers get bigger as one goes south and west respectively. There are some numbers that do not follow this, however, mostly with routes from other states keeping their number as they enter Delaware."}

Zinc more readily loses electrons than copper, so placing zinc and copper metal in solutions of their salts can cause electrons to flow through an external wire which leads from the zinc to the copper. As a zinc atom provides the electrons, it becomes a positive ion and goes into aqueous solution, decreasing the mass of the zinc electrode. On the copper side, the two electrons received allow it to convert a copper ion from solution into an uncharged copper atom which deposits on the copper electrode, increasing its mass. The two reactions are typically writtenZn(s) --> Zn2+(aq) + 2e-Cu2+(aq) + 2e-\u00a0--> Cu(s)The letters in parentheses are just reminders that the zinc goes from a solid (s) into a water solution (aq) and vice versa for the copper. It is typical in the language of electrochemistry to refer to these two processes as \"half-reactions\" which occur at the two electrodes."}
